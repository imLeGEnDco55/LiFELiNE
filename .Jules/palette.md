**Learning:** Icon-only buttons for core features like Pomodoro timers are completely inaccessible without labels. Tooltips enhance usability for mouse users while providing context that can mirror aria-labels.
**Action:** Always check interactive components (like timers and floating buttons) for accessible names, especially when they rely heavily on iconography.
