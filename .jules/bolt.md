## 2024-05-22 - TasksPage List Rendering
**Learning:** `TasksPage` performs O(N) grouping and filtering of subtasks on every render, which can become a bottleneck as the number of tasks grows. The existing pattern of using `useQuery` followed by synchronous processing in render is common but inefficient for large datasets.
**Action:** Always look for derived state calculations involving list iterations in page components and memoize them with `useMemo`.

## 2024-05-24 - Supabase Relational Filtering
**Learning:** Supabase/PostgREST queries filtering on joined tables (e.g., filtering subtasks by parent deadline status) default to LEFT JOIN behavior unless `!inner` is specified in the select clause (e.g., `select('*, deadline!inner(*)')`). Without `!inner`, filtering the parent returns null for the parent object but keeps the child row, failing to filter the child list itself server-side.
**Action:** Use `!inner` hints in Supabase select clauses when the goal is to filter the primary table based on conditions in the related table to ensure server-side payload reduction.

## 2024-05-25 - Nested Loop Aggregation in Charts
**Learning:** `DailyActivityChart` used an O(7*N) nested loop pattern (iterating days, then filtering all data for each day). This scales poorly as data grows.
**Action:** Replace nested "filter-by-day" loops with a single O(N) pass that calculates the target bucket index (e.g., `differenceInCalendarDays`) and pushes data into pre-initialized aggregators.
