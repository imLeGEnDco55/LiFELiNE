**Vulnerability:** Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) and strict Referrer Policy.
**Learning:** Single Page Applications (SPAs) built with Vite require 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' in script-src for development (HMR), which makes strict CSP challenging without a separate production build process that generates nonces.
**Prevention:** Added meta tags to index.html to enforce CSP and Referrer Policy, whitelisting only necessary domains (Supabase, Lovable).
