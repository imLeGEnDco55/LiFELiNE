## 2025-02-18 - [Security Enhancements]
**Vulnerability:** Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) and strict Referrer Policy.
**Learning:** Single Page Applications (SPAs) built with Vite require 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' in script-src for development (HMR), which makes strict CSP challenging without a separate production build process that generates nonces.
**Prevention:** Added meta tags to index.html to enforce CSP and Referrer Policy, whitelisting only necessary domains (Supabase, Lovable).

## 2025-05-18 - [Data Access Security]
**Vulnerability:** Client-side data fetching relied solely on Row Level Security (RLS) policies, requesting all records (`select('*')`) without explicit user filtering. If RLS were disabled or misconfigured, this would leak the entire database to any authenticated user.
**Learning:** Always implement "Defense in Depth". Explicitly filter data by `user_id` on the client side even if RLS is present. This acts as a safety net and documents the data access intent clearly.
**Prevention:** Updated `useCloudDeadlines.ts` to add `.eq('user_id', user.id)` to all fetch queries and removed sensitive data logging.

## 2025-05-19 - [Enhanced Auth Validation & Privacy]
**Vulnerability:** Weak input validation on authentication forms and PII exposure in console logs.
**Learning:** Client-side validation is the first line of defense against bad data and improves user feedback. Operational logs can inadvertently leak sensitive context (like User IDs) if not pruned for production.
**Prevention:** Implemented `isValidEmail` and `isValidPassword` checks in `AuthPage`. Removed `user.id` logging from `useCloudDeadlines`.

## 2026-02-11 - [Environment Configuration Security]
**Vulnerability:** `.env` file containing configuration keys was tracked in version control, creating a risk of accidental secret exposure.
**Learning:** Even "safe" public keys in `.env` encourage a pattern where developers might add sensitive secrets later, leading to catastrophic leaks. Git history is immutable for most intents; once a secret is committed, it's compromised.
**Prevention:** Created `.env.example` with placeholders, added `.env` to `.gitignore`, and removed the file from the git index. This enforces environment separation and prevents secret leakage.
